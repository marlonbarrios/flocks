# CULTURE BOTS

Tools for Ideological Flocking

In the US and in most of the globalized north, we are surrounded and chased by ideologies, trainings, iconographies, and trivializing representations of affect supported by money and historical trails. Tragic and hilarious...

I created ten generative tools to play and reflect.

You can change the number of agents, toggle the kinds of agents, the background color, you can 'draw traces', you may change the intensities of seeking behavior, separation and cohesion of the 'flock'

You can save a screenshot pressing 's'.

The computational aspects of these works are based on the influential paper Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters by 
Craig W. Reynolds.


Icons or agents are changed exploring what kind of narrative will emerge.

All pngs and gifs were foung in the web.
